				<h1>Visualising DNA Response Images</h1>
				<p>Each day, the DNA of healthy cells suffers from endogenous 
					replicative stress caused by competition between replication 
					forks, transcription sites, and other DNA-binding proteins. 
					This results in 5-50 DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) 
					occurring in each human replicating cell, every 24 hours. 
					Exogenous stressors such as cigarette smoke or alcohol only 
					serve to increase the total amount of DNA damage. DNA DSBs 
					need to be repaired without any loss or gain of genetic code 
					because this could potentially engender a mutation leading 
					to cell death of malfunction. Mutations and cell death 
					caused by DNA misrepair, often exacerbated by deficiencies 
					in repair pathways, underpin many cancers, autoimmune and 
					neurodegenerative diseases.
				</p>
				<p>Because of this, a plethora of 
					interacting and redundant repair proteins work within cells 
					to maintain genomic integrity, and much research has been 
					undertaken to try to understand and manipulate these 
					pathways â€“ particularly because inducing genomic stress 
					remains our primary method for treating cancer. However, 
					studying these pathways in vivo has been challenging because 
					of the high signal-to-noise within the dense, homogenous 
					nucleus, and the low level of endogenous DSB induction. 
					Using innovative labeling and super-resolution assays we aim 
					to elucidate damage and repair events at the single molecule 
					scale. In particular we are mapping the high-fidelity 
					homologous recombination repair of collapsed replication 
					forks, and investigating the role of transcriptional 
					silencing within the nucleolus.
